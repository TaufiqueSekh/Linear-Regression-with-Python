Linear regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm, commonly used for predictive analysis. As the name suggests, linear regression performs regression tasks. Now, what is regression? Well, regression is nothing but a technique that displays the relationship between two variables.
We refer to dependent variables as responses and independent variables as features.
In order to provide a basic understanding of linear regression, we start with the most basic version, i.e., simple linear regression.

Simple Linear Regression:-

Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature.
It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value (y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable (x).
The line of best fit is nothing but the line that best expresses the relationship between the data points. Let us see how to find the best-fit line in linear regression.

Let's build the Python linear regression models.
